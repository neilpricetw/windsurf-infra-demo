when I use the alias gc+p it means git commit and push to github.
when I use the alias tf+b it means run terraform for the backend folder (specify the AWS_PROFILE in the command).
use public terraform modules to keep the code clean and easy to understand.
donâ€™t create main.tf but instead create filenames that align with the contents.
apply logical best practices to all of this code.
ensure all variable values are supplied through a terraform.tfvars file where it makes sense.
add a project prefix variable that is part of the name tag on all resources.
add an appropriate gitignore file for a terraform project
add terraform fmt and terraform lint recursively as validation checks in git before any commits are made
